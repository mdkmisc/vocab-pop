documentation:
  - overall goals:
    - make individual OHDSI vocabularies more approachable - facilitate
      understanding of OHDSI's vocabularies and concepts, relationships between
      them, and their prevelance in a specific CDM
    - facilitate translation from individual source concepts for cohort or
      phenotype definition and for ETL work - facilitate development or
      translation of concept sets
    - provide tools and interface for classification/granularity selection in other contexts (e.g., patient profiles) - towards these ends: 
      - develop detailed requirements, designs, and prototypes
      - implement in ATLAS if and when resources are available
  - use cases:
    - source(s) to target(s):
      - find mapped or matching codes, classification or standard
      - in target code(s) selected, see which source codes are added or 
        left out and counts of corresponding patient records
    - explore the whole set of OHDSI vocabularies:
      - in general
      - only for concepts in user's CDM
      - for a specific domain:
        - e.g., provider specialty, show record counts for all values including
          zero counts for specialties not used; maybe also show corresponding
          source values and source values that weren't able to be mapped to a
          target. (provider.specialty_concept_id,
          provider.specialty_source_value,
          provider.specialty_source_concept_id, care_site.specialty_concept_id,
          care_site.specialty_source_value)
      - to better understand relationships between source and target domains
      - to better understand classifications available
    - find a concept:
      - have immediate feedback on CDM records with concept
      - see relationships to other concepts and be encouraged to assure one has
        chosen correctly
    - define a cohort or phenotype:
      - translate existing phenotype definition (e.g., set of ICD-9 codes for
        some condition) from a source vocabulary into a target vocabulary
    - explore my popupaltion:
      - overall
      - in terms of some domain
      - defining a subpopulation (same as 1)
      - intersecion of subpopulations
    - Patrick's SNOMED navigation strategy: 
      - using related concepts filter on Class, choose Has ancestor of from
        Relationship facet, filter on Distance facet

      - source record count:
        - show these as existing in cdm but not available through query
        - also show ancestor concepts with their descendant record counts
        - only show classification concepts that have a descendant record count
      - default to showing 4 main domains (condition, drug, procedure, measurement)
attributes of use:
  - exclude concept_id=0, No matching concept
  - include only primary target columns (e.g., drug_concept_id)
  - include only primary source columns (e.g., drug_source_concept_id)
